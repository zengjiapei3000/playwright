## How to Contribute

### Getting Code

1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/playwright
cd playwright
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

3. Build Playwright

```bash
npm run build
```

4. Run all Playwright tests locally. For more information about tests, read [Running & Writing Tests](#running--writing-tests).

```bash
npm test
```

### Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

### Code Style

- Coding style is fully defined in [.eslintrc](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/master/.eslintrc.js)
- Comments should be generally avoided. If the code would not be understood without comments, consider re-writing the code to make it self-explanatory.

To run code linter, use:

```bash
npm run eslint
```

### API guidelines

When authoring new API methods, consider the following:

- Expose as little information as needed. When in doubt, donâ€™t expose new information.
- Methods are used in favor of getters/setters.
  - The only exception is namespaces, e.g. `page.keyboard` and `page.coverage`
- All string literals must be small case. This includes event names and option values.
- Avoid adding "sugar" API (API that is trivially implementable in user-space) unless they're **very** common.

### Commit Messages

Commit messages should follow the Semantic Commit Messages format:

```
label(namespace): title

description

footer
```

1. *label* is one of the following:
    - `fix` - playwright bug fixes.
    - `feat` - playwright features.
    - `docs` - changes to docs, e.g. `docs(api.md): ..` to change documentation.
    - `test` - changes to playwright tests infrastructure.
    - `devops` - build-related work, e.g. CI related patches and general changes to the browser build infrastructure
    - `chore` - everything that doesn't fall under previous categories
2. *namespace* is put in parenthesis after label and is optional. Must be lowercase.
3. *title* is a brief summary of changes.
4. *description* is **optional**, new-line separated from title and is in present tense.
5. *footer* is **optional**, new-line separated from *description* and contains "fixes" / "references" attribution to github issues.

Example:

```
fix(firefox): make sure session cookies work

This patch fixes session cookies in firefox browser.

Fixes #123, fixes #234
```

### Writing Documentation

All public API should have a descriptive entry in [`docs/api.md`](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/master/docs/api.md). There's a [documentation linter](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/tree/master/utils/doclint) which makes sure documentation is aligned with the codebase.

To run the documentation linter, use:

```bash
npm run doc
```

### Adding New Dependencies

For all dependencies (both installation and development):
- **Do not add** a dependency if the desired functionality is easily implementable.
- If adding a dependency, it should be well-maintained and trustworthy.

A barrier for introducing new installation dependencies is especially high:
- **Do not add** installation dependency unless it's critical to project success.

### Running & Writing Tests

- Every feature should be accompanied by a test.
- Every public api event/method should be accompanied by a test.
- Tests should be *hermetic*. Tests should not depend on external services.
- Tests should work on all three platforms: Mac, Linux and Win. This is especially important for screenshot tests.

Playwright tests are located in [`test/test.js`](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/master/test/test.js)
and are written with a [TestRunner](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/tree/master/utils/testrunner) framework.
These are integration tests, making sure public API methods and events work as expected.

- To run all tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

- To run all tests in Chromium
```bash
npm run ctest # also `ftest` for firefox and `wtest` for WebKit
```

- To run tests in parallel, use `-j` flag:

```bash
npm run wtest -- -j 4
```

- To run tests in "verbose" mode or to stop testrunner on first failure:

```bash
npm run ftest -- --verbose
npm run ftest -- --break-on-failure
```

- To run a specific test, substitute the `it` with `fit` (mnemonic rule: '*focus it*'):

```js
...
// Using "fit" to run specific test
fit('should work', async ({server, page}) => {
  const response = await page.goto(server.EMPTY_PAGE);
  expect(response.ok).toBe(true);
});
```

- To disable a specific test, substitute the `it` with `xit` (mnemonic rule: '*cross it*'):

```js
...
// Using "xit" to skip specific test
xit('should work', async ({server, page}) => {
  const response = await page.goto(server.EMPTY_PAGE);
  expect(response.ok).toBe(true);
});
```

- To run tests in non-headless (headful) mode:

```bash
HEADLESS=false npm run ctest
```

- To run tests with custom browser executable, specify `CRPATH`, `WKPATH` or `FFPATH` env variable that points to browser executable:

```bash
CRPATH=<path-to-executable> npm run ctest
```

- To run tests in slow-mode:

```bash
HEADLESS=false SLOW_MO=500 npm run wtest
```

- To debug a test, "focus" a test first and then run:

```bash
BROWSER=chromium node --inspect-brk test/test.js
```

- When should a test be marked with `skip` or `fail`?

  - **`skip(condition)`**: This test *should ***never*** work* for `condition`
    where `condition` is usually a certain browser like `FFOX` (for Firefox),
    `WEBKIT` (for WebKit), and `CHROMIUM` (for Chromium).

    For example, the [alt-click downloads test](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/471ccc72d3f0847caa36f629b394a028c7750d93/test/download.spec.js#L86) is marked
    with `skip(FFOX)` since an alt-click in Firefox will not produce a download
    even if a person was driving the browser.


  - **`fail(condition)`**: This test *should ***eventually*** work* for `condition`
    where `condition` is usually a certain browser like `FFOX` (for Firefox),
    `WEBKIT` (for WebKit), and `CHROMIUM` (for Chromium).

    For example, the [alt-click downloads test](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/471ccc72d3f0847caa36f629b394a028c7750d93/test/download.spec.js#L86) is marked
    with `fail(CHROMIUM || WEBKIT)` since Playwright performing these actions
    currently diverges from what a user would experience driving a Chromium or
    WebKit.

### Public API Coverage

Every public API method or event should be called at least once in tests. To ensure this, there's a `coverage` command which tracks calls to public API and reports back if some methods/events were not called.

Run all tests for all browsers with coverage enabled:

```bash
npm run coverage
```

There are also per-browser commands:" `npm run ccoverage`, `npm run fcoverage` and `npm run wcoverage`.
